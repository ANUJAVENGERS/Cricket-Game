# Cricket-Game

A cricket game similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a simple and fun interactive experience where players choose between different cricket-related options to compete against the computer. The HTML structure includes elements for player input and displaying results, CSS styles the game interface, and JavaScript manages the game logic, determining the winner based on player and computer choices.
